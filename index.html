                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
                long-distance
                telephone communication
                by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as
                "pupinization").

            </p>


            <p>
                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915,
                which
                later
                became NASA.
