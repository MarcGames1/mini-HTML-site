                Pupin's <strong>1899</strong> patent for loading coils, archaically called <i>"Pupin coils"</i>,
                followed closely on the pioneering work
                of the English physicist and mathematician <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside"
                    target="blank"><strong>Oliver Heaviside</strong></a>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven
                years.
                <br> The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by
                American Telephone &
                Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.

            <p>
                Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own
                development in
                hand led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ashley_Campbell" target="blank"><strong>George
                        Campbell</strong></a> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own
                patent.
                AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability
                to greatly
                extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
