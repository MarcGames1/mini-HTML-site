    <p>
        Pupin's <strong>1899</strong> patent for loading coils, archaically called <i>"Pupin coils"</i>, followed closely on the pioneering work
        of the English physicist and mathematician <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside" target="blank"><strong>Oliver Heaviside</strong></a>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.
        <br> The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &
        Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.
    </p>

        Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in
        hand led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ashley_Campbell" target="blank"><strong>George Campbell</strong></a> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
        AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
        extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
